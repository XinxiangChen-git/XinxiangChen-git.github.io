Within the framework of a dynamic self-consistent field theory, we study the effect of the correlations in a small scale on polymer dynamics, adopting the semiflexible homopolymer blends as the model system. This is accomplished by taking the pair correlation function of ideal semiflexible chains as the Onsager coefficient and the Debye function as an approximation to the Onsager coefficient. Relying on the difference of the two pair correlation functions in the small-scale region, we can identify the effect of small-scale correlations. In the equilibrium state, with the chain length growing, the interface width has a continuous transition from the contour length to radius of gyration. The investigation of interfacial evolution and chain orientation reveals that strong small-scale correlations would accelerate the small-scale dynamic process. We also expect that such a small-scale effect should be highlighted in the process where microscopic phase separation happens.
